            <p class="text-cont">For this project, the goal was to get familiar with the Angular Materials library. I had been using some basic components like cards, input fields, buttons etc for my projects. There is a toggle component for the function I intended the program to have but I was interested in chips(component) which gave way to the multiple colour concept of the project.</p>

                Using the chips component from the Materials library, my first thought was figuring out how to use it like a filter. Ideally, I figured I could have a function for each colour change. But that would mean that if I had to account for more colours, thereâ€™d be too many repetitive elements and functions to write which isn't efficient. My solution was to use an array of objects to which I assigned a name and property colour key. I used the array to generate the chip elements dynamically and pass the name key as labels and display it using string interpolation. Within the chip element, I called a function (yet to be created) that passes in the property colour. I then created the function which takes in the button(chip) value, then initialize it to a variable which I used to pass into HTML DOM using document.getElement then set the colour property of the card to the variable value.
